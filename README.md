# AI Shimmer Fixer
Fix (reduce) that pesky shimmering that happens so often on AI generated videos. Requires .NET 10 or newer to build.

I built this with Gemini and ChatGPT, so ask them if you don't understand the constants or code :)

And I've only tested it on MP4 files, so your mileage may vary with other formats.

Usage: inputVideoFile outputVideoFile
